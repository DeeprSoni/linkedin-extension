CHROME EXTENSION PERMISSIONS RATIONALE

This document explains each permission requested by the LinkedIn Connection Scanner extension and why it is necessary for functionality.

---

PERMISSIONS REQUESTED:

1. "storage"
   PURPOSE: Store prospect data, settings, and user preferences locally on the user's device
   USAGE: Saves scanned LinkedIn profiles, tags, notes, message templates, and campaign data
   DATA SCOPE: All data remains local; nothing is transmitted externally
   JUSTIFICATION: Essential for persistence between browsing sessions

2. "activeTab"
   PURPOSE: Access the currently active LinkedIn tab to read profile information
   USAGE: Reads publicly visible profile data from LinkedIn pages the user is currently viewing
   DATA SCOPE: Only accesses pages when user explicitly clicks extension or scan button
   JUSTIFICATION: Required to extract profile information for scanning feature

3. "sidePanel"
   PURPOSE: Display extension interface in Chrome's side panel
   USAGE: Shows prospect list, filters, and management tools in dedicated side panel UI
   DATA SCOPE: UI display only; no additional data access
   JUSTIFICATION: Provides better user experience than popup with persistent, resizable interface

4. "scripting"
   PURPOSE: Inject content scripts into LinkedIn pages to enable scanning functionality
   USAGE: Injects scanner button and profile extraction logic into LinkedIn.com pages
   DATA SCOPE: Only executes on LinkedIn.com domains where user initiates action
   JUSTIFICATION: Required to interact with LinkedIn's page structure and DOM elements

---

HOST PERMISSIONS REQUESTED:

1. "https://www.linkedin.com/*"
   PURPOSE: Access LinkedIn pages to read publicly visible profile information
   USAGE: Extracts names, headlines, companies, locations, and mutual connection counts
   DATA SCOPE: Only accesses information already visible to the logged-in user
   JUSTIFICATION: Core functionality requires reading LinkedIn page content

   IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
   - Does NOT access LinkedIn's private API
   - Does NOT capture or store login credentials
   - Does NOT access private messages or non-public information
   - Does NOT perform automated actions without explicit user input
   - Does NOT send messages automatically (user must click and type manually)
   - Only reads DOM elements of pages user is actively viewing

---

MINIMAL PERMISSIONS PRINCIPLE:

This extension follows the principle of minimal permissions by:
- Requesting only permissions essential for stated functionality
- NOT requesting broad "tabs" permission (uses more specific "activeTab" instead)
- NOT requesting "webRequest" or network interception capabilities
- NOT requesting access to browsing history
- NOT requesting access to other websites beyond LinkedIn
- Storing all data locally (not requiring remote server access)

---

PERMISSION USAGE IN PRACTICE:

When user clicks "Scan 2nd Connections":
1. activeTab + scripting: Read current LinkedIn search/network page structure
2. scripting: Extract visible profile information (name, headline, location, etc.)
3. storage: Save extracted data to local Chrome storage
4. sidePanel: Display scanned prospects in side panel interface

When user views prospect list:
1. storage: Retrieve saved prospect data from local storage
2. sidePanel: Display data in side panel with filters and controls

When user exports data:
1. storage: Retrieve prospect data
2. Generate CSV file (using standard browser download API, no special permission needed)

When user clicks profile or "Message" button:
1. NO special permissions used - standard navigation and clicks work without permission

DATA FLOW SUMMARY:

LinkedIn Page → Content Script (reads DOM) → Local Storage → Side Panel Display
                      ↓
                  (No external transmission)

All data processing happens locally on the user's device. No data is sent to external servers.

---

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

- All permissions are used exclusively for stated functionality
- No data collection or telemetry
- No third-party analytics or tracking
- No remote code execution
- All data remains on user's device unless explicitly exported by user
- Extension does not communicate with any external servers
