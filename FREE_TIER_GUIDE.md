## Yes, This Extension Works Without Premium! 🎉

You can absolutely use this extension with a free LinkedIn account. Here's what you need to know:

## What You Get on Free LinkedIn

### ✅ Full Access To:

**1. People Search**
- ~1000 search results per query
- Basic filters: Location, Current Company, Past Company, School, Industry
- Connection degree visibility (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Mutual connections count

**2. My Network Page**
- "People You May Know" suggestions (~100-200 at a time)
- All are typically 2nd degree connections
- Based on your profile and existing connections

**3. Profile Information**
- Name, headline, company, location
- Mutual connections

### ❌ Premium Features You'll Miss:

- More search results (Premium unlocks more)
- InMail messages (not needed for this tool)
- Extended network visibility

## Strategies to Maximize Free Tier

### 1. Use Multiple Search Queries

Instead of one broad search, break it down:

**Example: Looking for marketing managers in San Francisco**

Run separate searches:
- Search 1: "Marketing Manager" + Company: "Salesforce"
- Search 2: "Marketing Manager" + Company: "Airbnb"
- Search 3: "Marketing Manager" + Company: "Stripe"
- Search 4: "Marketing Manager" + School: "Stanford University"

**Why this works:**
- Each search shows ~1000 results
- 10 targeted searches = 10,000 potential prospects
- More targeted = better quality connections

### 2. Leverage My Network Page

**Best practices:**
1. Go to linkedin.com/mynetwork/
2. LinkedIn shows personalized recommendations
3. Scan these - they're often high-quality matches
4. Refresh the page after a few days for new suggestions

**Why this works:**
- LinkedIn's algorithm shows relevant people
- Usually 2nd degree connections
- High acceptance rate (LinkedIn recommends them)

### 3. Search by Company/School

**Strategy:**
```
1. Identify 20 target companies
2. Search: People who work at [Company Name]
3. Scan each company separately
4. Repeat for schools/universities
```

**Why this works:**
- Bypasses search result limits
- More specific = better targeting
- Can collect thousands of prospects

### 4. Use Boolean Searches

LinkedIn free tier supports Boolean operators:

**Examples:**
- `"Software Engineer" OR "Developer"` - finds either title
- `"CEO" AND "startup"` - finds CEOs mentioning startups
- `Marketing NOT Manager` - excludes managers

**Why this works:**
- Refines results without Premium filters
- Gets around free tier limitations
- More precise targeting

### 5. Geographic Filtering

**Strategy:**
```
Search in specific cities one at a time:
- San Francisco
- New York
- Austin
- Remote
```

**Why this works:**
- Each location = separate 1000 result pool
- Better localized targeting
- Easier to personalize connection requests

## Recommended Workflow for Free Users

### Week 1: Research Phase
- [ ] List 10-20 target companies
- [ ] List 5-10 job titles you want to connect with
- [ ] List 3-5 locations you're targeting

### Week 2-4: Scanning Phase
Run these scans (30 min each):
- [ ] Monday: Scan My Network page
- [ ] Tuesday: Scan Company #1-3
- [ ] Wednesday: Scan Company #4-6
- [ ] Thursday: Scan Company #7-9
- [ ] Friday: Review all prospects, export to CSV

### Ongoing: Connection Phase

## Workaround: The "Connection Mining" Technique

**Advanced strategy for free users:**

1. **Find a Well-Connected Person**
   - Someone in your target industry
   - Who has 500+ connections
   - Preferably a 1st degree connection

2. **View Their Connections**
   - Go to their profile → See all connections
   - Many will be 2nd degree to you
   - Scan this page

3. **Repeat with Multiple People**
   - Find 10 well-connected people
   - Mine their networks
   - Massive prospect pool

**Why this works:**
- Bypasses search limits completely
- Access to curated networks
- High-quality connections (validated by mutual connection)

## Tips to Get More Value on Free Tier

### 1. Optimize Your Profile First
Before scanning, make sure your LinkedIn profile is strong:
- Professional photo

**Why:** Higher acceptance rate = better ROI from free scans

### 2. Start with Warm Connections
Priority order:
1. Alumni from your school (highest acceptance)
2. People at your current/past companies
3. 2nd degree with 5+ mutual connections
4. 2nd degree with 1-4 mutual connections
5. Everyone else

### 3. Scan Multiple Times Per Week
- My Network page refreshes with new suggestions
- Search results change slightly
- Catch new prospects regularly

### 4. Export Regularly
- Free tier has no export limits
- Back up your prospect list weekly
- Track who you've contacted in a spreadsheet
